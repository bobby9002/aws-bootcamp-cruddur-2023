we can verify using following commands docker -v ,docker to confirm it is installed .

Docker Desktop for Windows provides a development environment for building, shipping, and running dockerized apps. By enabling the WSL 2 based engine, we can run both Linux and Windows containers in Docker Desktop on the same machine.

When we use Docker desktop, we have access to docker in powershell/cmd, have access to your file on windows, the possibility to switch to Windows container and to use it with your IDE.

In order to docker work in widows wsl2 -ex ubuntu ,centos8 we have to enable wsl integration under settings Resources.

## Running the Cruddur Application Local

I have installed Github Desktop on windows using the following link.

You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop with visual confirmation of changes. You can push to, pull from, and clone remote repositories with GitHub Desktop, and use collaborative tools such as attributing commits and creating pull requests.

once we clone the repo on the desktop we will be able to run it locally.
